### In-Progress

Summary: Original Dataset for USA, UK, and Austrailia was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imyjoshua/average-time-spent-by-a-user-on-social-media) and filtered using Python. The analysis was built using R. Here the association between age, platform, and time spent on social media were analyzed.
